## Introduction

Cybercypher is a project that builds upon the core concepts of the classic memory card game, but with an intriguing twist! Players assume the role of a computer hacker in a dystopian cyberpunk world, tasked with using their skills to breach a mainframe and access secret data. The objective is to match the correct symbols on a computer terminal, but the challenge is that players have a limited amount of time and attempts to beat the game and achieve their mission.

Players can tailor their gaming experience by selecting from a range of difficulty levels: novice, pro, and elite. Each mode adjusts the number of attempts a player gets and the time allotted to complete the game, ensuring an exciting and replayable experience.

## Design

- #### Colour Scheme
  ### <img src="assets/images/readme/design/colour-scheme.webp">
  Inspired by the aesthetics of retro sci-fi, I deliberately opted for a relatively minimalist color palette. I subtly tweaked the black and white values, infusing a subtle hint of red to evoke an analog vibe. The usage of monochromatic cyan values aim to capture the essence of a vintage computer terminal. To enhance these color values and create a neon-like ambiance, I've incorporated glows to align with the sci-fi theme.
- #### Typography
  ### <img src="assets/images/readme/design/typography.webp">
  During my research on 80s sci-fi novels to get visual inspiration, I observed that many book covers featured bold sans-serif fonts that demanded attention. Consequently, I chose the Magistral font from Adobe as the primary typeface for my web app. Its presence greatly contributes to the overall retro scfi atmosphere of the game.
- #### Imagery

  ### <img src="assets/images/readme/design/imagery.webp">

  The icons and design elements draw inspiration from the cyberpunk and sci-fi motifs commonly found in the interfaces of machines and screen UIs, adding a touch of futuristic allure. All images SVG, allowing them to be infginitly scalable and have miniscule file sizes to boost website perfomance and download speeds.

- #### Wireframes

  I started things off by creating the initial website wireframes using Figma. This allowed me to fine-tune the design, play around with images, typography, colors, and layout. I then organized everything into a design system to ensure that all design elements stayed consistent. Once I was happy with the UI/UX design and where the content was placed, I moved on to the coding phase of the project.

<br />

<h3 align="center">Main Menu Section</h3>

### <img src="assets/images/readme/features/main-menu.webp" alt="The main menu section">

- The Main menu section serves as the main point of entry into the game and is where players can choose from one of three difficulty levels. It serves as a container for all other menu elements.

- It is designed to reflect the look of a machine with cut beveled edges and interface elements like a battery meter and energy bar.

- The title is displayed prominently at the top and is surrounded by cyberpunk design elements to help impart the sci-fi feel of the game.

- The interactive menu at the bottom serves as the "screen" of the device and is where players can start the game and view the instructions.

<br />

---

<br />

<h3 align="center">Interactive Menu Section</h3>

### <div align="center"><img src="assets/images/readme/features/interactive-menu.webp" alt="The interactive menu section"></div>

- The interactive menu allows the player to begin the game by selecting one of three modes in increasing levels of difficulty: Novice, Pro, and Elite.

  - **Novice Mode** - Selecting the **Novice** mode starts the game, giving the player **8 lives** and a timer length of **60 seconds**.

  - **Pro Mode** - Selecting the **Pro** mode starts the game, giving the player **8 lives** and a timer length of **60 seconds**.

  - **Elite Mode** - Selecting the **Elite** mode starts the game, giving the player **5 lives** and a timer length of **30 seconds**.

<br />

---

<br />

<h3 align="center">Instructions Section</h3>

![Alt text](assets/images/readme/features/interactive-menu-instructions.gif)

- The instructions are accessed by clicking on the icon with the annotated arrow at the bottom right corner of the interactive menu section.

- When this button is clicked, the screen glitch transitions to reveal the instructions text.

- The back button returns to the interactive menu where players can select the difficulty level.

- The text is responsive and changes size to accommodate the changing width of the menu on a range of screen sizes. I wanted to ensure it could still be readable and not spill out of the sides of the menu width.

<br />

---

<br />

<h3 align="center">Countdown Bar</h3>

![The countdown bar](assets/images/readme/features/countdown-bar.gif)

- The Countdown bar serves as a visual indicator to the player of how much time is remaining in the game. Players must match all tiles before it becomes empty.

- When the bar becomes 75% empty, it begins to flash, adding further feedback to the player.

- The bar scales in proportion to the game grid to ensure that it is clearly visible on all devices and screen sizes.

- It uses CSS animations to impart a neon glow effect, making it feel like an element of digital UI.

<br />

---

<br />

<h3 align="center">Life Meter</h3>

<img src="assets/images/readme/features/lives-meter.webp">

- The number of hack attempts (or lives) is shown to the player here.

- If the player fails to match two tiles, then this value will decrement by one point.

- If there are no attempts remaining, then the game will automatically end and display the game over screen.

<br />

---

<br />

<h3 align="center">Grid Tile</h3>

![A single grid tile](assets/images/readme/features/game-tile.gif)

- The grid tile is the interactable element of the game board. Each grid tile is assigned one of 8 random images.

- Each grid tile is given a click event listener which plays a glitch video overlay on click.

- While a tile is active, a CSS class is appended to make it non-clickable to prevent the player from accidentally selecting it a second time.

- When two tiles do not match, they are once again hidden from the player. The click events still remain, and the non-clickable CSS class is removed to allow them to be selected once more.

- When two tiles match, they remain revealed and the click event handlers are removed from them to prevent them from being clicked again for the duration of the game.

<br />

---

<br />

<h3 align="center">Game Grid</h3>

<div align="center"><img src="assets/images/readme/features/game-grid.webp" alt="The game grid" width="400"></div>

- The game acts as a container for all of the game tiles and renders them in a 4 by 4 grid.

- The grid container is designed to be responsive and allow the grid tiles to shrink and expand fluidly with changes in the viewport size.

- The game grid is used to display either a victory or game over screen depending on if the player is able to complete the game or not.

<br />

---

<br />

<h3 align="center">Game Over Screen</h3>

![The game over screen](assets/images/readme/features/game-over-screen.gif)

- The game over screen is shown when the player unsuccessfully attempts to match all of the tiles.

- This Screen will be shown if the timer runs out before game completion.

- This Screen will be shown if the player runs out of lives.

- Contains a restart button should the player wish to replay the game without having to exit to the main menu to start a new game.

<br />

---

<br />

<h3 align="center">Victory Screen</h3>

![The victory screen](assets/images/readme/features/victory-screen.gif)

- The victory is shown when the player manages to successfully match all of the tiles and win the game.

- This Screen will be shown if the player matches all tiles before the timer runs out.

- This Screen will be shown if the player matches all tiles while lives are still remaining.

- Contains a restart button should the player wish to replay the game without having to exit to the main menu to start a new game.

<br />

---

<br />

<h3 align="center">404 Page</h3>

<div align="center"><img src="assets/images/readme/features/404-page.webp" alt="Custom 404 error page" width="400"></div>

- The 404 Page showcases a full-screen background that aligns with the site's visual theme, reinforcing to users that they remain on the familiar site. Along with a message highlighting the page's unavailability, a conveniently placed button directs users back to the main menu, enhancing their user experience.

<br />

---

<br />

### Future Implementations

1. **Adding More Tiles**

   - As an additional layer of challenge, I could implement more tiles for the game beyond the current eight.

   - Depending on the difficulty level selected, the game could add more or fewer tiles to further enhance the experience and present an additional layer of challenge.

   <br/>

2. **Implement Score Tracker**

   - Implement a score system that rewards players for their skill.

   - Scores could be awarded based on how fast they match tiles together.

   - The selected difficulty could be used as a bonus multiplier, rewarding players who take on higher levels of difficulty and greater challenges.

   <br/>

3. **Implement Leaderboard**

   - Implement a scoreboard system that stores players' scores.

   - Users can input their name and be added to the leaderboard which could be viewed from the main menu or after a game is won.

   - This would encourage friendly competition between players, motivating them to solve the game faster each time, adding an additional layer of fun.

### Accessibility

**Using Semantic Elements** - The HTML is organized with semantic elements. This provides more clarity to the content, and enhances the experience for users with screen readers.

**Clean Sans-Serif Type** - The primary text on the website utilizes a sans-serif font. This choice aids individuals with dyslexia, ensuring they can easily read the content.

**Adaptive Font Scaling** - I've set the font sizes using REM units, which adjust according to the browser's base font size. This design decision means that those who need a larger font size, like people with vision challenges, can resize text without disrupting the website's structure.

**Reduced Motion Preference** - A specific CSS code has been integrated, responding to the prefers-reduced-motion media query. Users who opt for minimal motion will see animations disabled, creating a more comfortable and accessible environment for those who might find excessive animations disturbing.

**Aria Live Attribute** - In researching aria labels I learned that for elements that will change over time, like the life counter, would benefit from an aria-live attribute. This ensures that screen readers announce changes to these elements for the player.
